# Unrolled-GAN-for-Mixed-Guassian-Points
This repository implements UNROLLED GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02163.pdf).

Main code from https://github.com/mk-minchul/unroll_gan

Several differences for 

1. Use different Guassian points generating function for both Ring and Grid.
2. Change the style of visualization.
